The spam looks like this:

Importing a server blacklist
First things first, you want to download the server blacklist from here

The latter are just fake servers, that you can't even connect to because the IPs are fake.
In this guide I will be showing you how to fix it.


There should be a download raw file at the right side of the page

After you've downloaded it, open CS:S and open the server browser and switch to the "blacklisted servers" tab

Click "import servers from file" at the bottom

A file picker should appear and you should select the server_blacklist.txt file you downloaded, the game should freeze for a bit and servers will appear in the blacklisted servers tab.


If this does not work for you, copy over the server_blacklist.txt file to the cstrike/cfg folder.

The end
After you've imported the server blacklist, your server browser should look like this



If some new servers appear, right click and add to blacklist, if there are a lot, click one then hold shift and click the one you want to end on and right click and add to blacklist. (game might freeze during this)
